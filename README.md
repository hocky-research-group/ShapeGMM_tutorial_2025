# ShapeGMM Tutorial Article

This repository accompanies the article "Tutorial on quantifying and sampling biomolecular ensembles with ShapeGMM". 
It contains two folders:

- `generate_data`: Input files to generate the data analyzed in the tutorial

- `analyze_data`: Jupyter notebooks used to analyze the data and perform steps of the tutorial. Some analysis is cached in saved files. 
To perform the tutorial compleely from scratch, remove the folder `analyze_data/outputs`

To perform the tutorial without running any molecular dynamics simulations, 
raw simulation data outputs can be downloaded from [NYU Box](https://nyu.box.com/s/7pfuifsoxe2z6yqsgl2qveb3qjhmpkfz). 
In this case, `generate_data` should be replaced by the version downloaded from Box.
